NAME
----
cdist-reference - Variable, path and type reference for cdist


EXPLORERS
---------
The following global explorers are available:

eof
(
    cd ../../cdist/conf/explorer
    for explorer in *; do
       echo "- $explorer"
    done
)

cat << eof 

PATHS
-----
\$HOME/.cdist::
    The standard cdist configuration directory relative to your home directory
    This is usually the place you want to store your site specific configuration

cdist/conf/::
    The distribution configuration directory
    This contains types and explorers to be used

confdir::
    Cdist will use all available configuration directories and create
    a temporary confdir containing links to the real configuration directories.
    This way it is possible to merge configuration directories.
    By default it consists of everything in \$HOME/.cdist and cdist/conf/.
    For more details see cdist(1)

confdir/manifest/init::
    This is the central entry point.
    It is an executable (+x bit set) shell script that can use
    values from the explorers to decide which configuration to create
    for the specified target host.
    Its intent is to used to define mapping from configurations to hosts.

confdir/manifest/*::
    All other files in this directory are not directly used by cdist, but you
    can seperate configuration mappings, if you have a lot of code in the
    conf/manifest/init file. This may also be helpful to have different admins
    maintain different groups of hosts.

confdir/explorer/<name>::
    Contains explorers to be run on the target hosts, see cdist-explorer(7).

confdir/type/::
    Contains all available types, which are used to provide
    some kind of functionality. See cdist-type(7).

confdir/type/<name>/::
    Home of the type <name>.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __type (see below).

confdir/type/<name>/man.text::
    Manpage in Asciidoc format (required for inclusion into upstream)

confdir/type/<name>/manifest::
    Used to generate additional objects from a type.

confdir/type/<name>/gencode-local::
    Used to generate code to be executed on the source host

confdir/type/<name>/gencode-remote::
    Used to generate code to be executed on the target host

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/required::
    Parameters required by type, \n seperated list.

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/optional::
    Parameters optionally accepted by type, \n seperated list.

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/default/*::
    Default values for optional parameters.
    Assuming an optional parameter name of 'foo', it's default value would
    be read from the file confdir/type/<name>/parameter/default/foo.

confdir/type/<name>/parameter/boolean::
    Boolean parameters accepted by type, \n seperated list.

confdir/type/<name>/explorer::
    Location of the type specific explorers.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __type_explorer (see below).
    See cdist-explorer(7).

confdir/type/<name>/files::
    This directory is reserved for user data and will not be used
    by cdist at any time

out/::
    This directory contains output of cdist and is usually located
    in a temporary directory and thus will be removed after the run.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __global (see below).

out/explorer::
    Output of general explorers.

out/object::
    Objects created for the host.

out/object/<object>::
    Contains all object specific information.
    This directory is referenced by the variable __object (see below).

out/object/<object>/explorers::
    Output of type specific explorers, per object.

TYPES
-----
The following types are available:

eof

for type in man7/cdist-type__*.text; do
    no_dir="${type#man7/}";
    no_type="${no_dir#cdist-type}";
    name="${no_type%.text}";
    name_no_underline="$(echo $name | sed 's/^__/\\__/g')"
    man="${no_dir%.text}(7)"

    echo "- $name_no_underline" "($man)"
done

cat << eof


OBJECTS
-------
For object to object communication and tests, the following paths are
usable within a object directory:

changed::
    This empty file exists in an object directory, if the object has
    code to be excuted (either remote or local)


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
__explorer::
    Directory that contains all global explorers.
    Available for: initial manifest, explorer, type explorer, shell
__manifest::
    Directory that contains the initial manifest.
    Available for: initial manifest, type manifest, shell
__global::
    Directory that contains generic output like explorer.
    Available for: initial manifest, type manifest, type gencode, shell
__object::
    Directory that contains the current object.
    Available for: type manifest, type explorer, type gencode
__object_id::
    The type unique object id.
    Available for: type manifest, type explorer, type gencode
    Note: The leading and the trailing "/" will always be stripped (caused by
    the filesystem database and ensured by the core).
    Note: Double slashes ("//") will not be fixed and result in an error.

    The full qualified name of the current object.
    Available for: type manifest, type explorer, type gencode
